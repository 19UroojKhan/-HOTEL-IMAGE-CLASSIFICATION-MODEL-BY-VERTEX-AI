# Company Project : HOTEL-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-MODEL-BY-VERTEX-AI
The integrated solutions comprise a Vertex AI image classification model for hotel images. The goal of this project is to streamline two critical tasks in the hospitality industry: classifying hotel photos based on trip types.

# TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES 
● Vertex AI: Used for developing and deploying the image classification model.
Vertex AI provides a suite of tools for building, training, and deploying machine
learning models.
● Python: Utilized for scripting both the image classification model and the invoice
processing tool.
● TensorFlow/Keras: Framework used for training the image classification model.
● Pandas, NumPy: Libraries utilized for data manipulation and preprocessing.
● Matplotlib: Used for data visualization and analysis.

# Description 
The integrated solutions consist of two main components:

Hotel Image Classification:
The Vertex AI image classification model is trained to categorize hotel photos into the
following classes:

Business Trip Hotels, Family Trip Hotels, Leisure Trip Hotels, No Label

Upon uploading a new hotel photo, the model predicts its class based on its features and assigns it accordingly. If the photo doesn't match any predefined labels, it falls into the "No Label" category.

# Conclusion 
The integrated solutions offer a comprehensive approach to streamlining tasks in the hospitality industry. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing
technologies, the project enhances efficiency and accuracy in classifying hotel photos and extracting billing details from receipts. Moving forward, potential improvements include expanding the range of supported hotel classes and enhancing the robustness of the image classification model.
